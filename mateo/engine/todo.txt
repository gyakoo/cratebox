HIGH
====
* Setting the texture/samplestate constant? now it stores in memory in ShaderConstant::resNumber, but now what?
* Parallel vectors for DxFactory. Since there's Async tasks, one can be modifying a vector while other too.

MEDIUM
======
* Inside DxDeviceFactory, implement search for DXSTATE_RELEASED slots in vectors before push_back a new one.
* Inside DxDeviceFactory, implement the hash for some DxResources and look for it before creating a new one.
* Change first letter to uppercase of methods
* Integrate VLD

LOW
===
* Make a tool to reflect shader byteco
des offline and save the .cso + reflection in a single file that is loaded on runtime.
  - it will remove the need for the compiler dlls in the package as well as their memory footprint when loaded.
