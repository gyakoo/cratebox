hkNanoSamples
====================

* This is a very simple example how to integrate initialize Havok base, Physics and Ai in your application.
* This example is tried to be self-contained, no demo framework involved.
* Console. No graphics. To visualize the sample, run hkVisualDebugger.exe under bin/ directory.
* It is built by default for havok 2014_2_5 and you must change the following path variables in
    win32vs2012.lua before building:
    - HAVOK_SDK
    - HAVOK_LIB
* Dbl-click buildvs2012.bat to generate the VS solution.

NOTE!!
The VS solution of this sample is built with premake for simplicity.
DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE THE PREMAKE SCRIPT/EXECUTABLE UNTIL FIRST CHECK WITH MSFT LCA!!
